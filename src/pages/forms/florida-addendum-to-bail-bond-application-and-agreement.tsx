          at any time as provided by law.
          <br />
          <br />
          2. In the event your surrender is made prior to the time set for your
          appearances, and for reasons other than as enumerated below in
          Paragraph 3, then a refund of the Bond premium shall be made to the
          person whose name appears as Payer on the Premium Receipt.
          <br />
          <br />
          3. It is understood and agreed that the happening of any one of the
          following events shall constitute a breach of your obligations to
          Surety, and Surety shall have the right to immediately apprehend,

          refund of premium whatsoever. The events which constitute a breach of

            (c) If you commit any act which constitutes reasonable evidence of
            your intention to cause a forfeiture of the Bond;
            <br />
            <br />
            (d) If you are arrested and incarcerated for any offense other than
