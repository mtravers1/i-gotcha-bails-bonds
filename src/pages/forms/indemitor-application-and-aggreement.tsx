                3. Subject to applicable law (if any) as stated in an attached
                addendum: (a) any property or collateral you deposit is
                deposited as security for the payment of any and all monies and
                sums due to Surety or Producer, including all liability,
                demands, damages, judgments, interest, attorneys’ fees and costs
                suffered, sustained, made or incurred by Surety or Producer on
                account of, arising out of or relating to the Bond and
                transactions contemplated thereby (including, without
                limitation, the items referenced in Paragraph 2 above), your
                failure to comply with the terms and conditions of this
                Agreement, and any and all debt or other obligations arising out
                of or evidenced by any agreement executed by Defendant, you or
                any other indemnitor for the benefit of Surety or Producer
                (“Liabilities”); and (b) if you grant the Surety a lien or a
                security interest in any property or collateral to enforce the
                obligations contained in this Agreement, and if you do not
                perform all of your obligations in this Agreement, you authorize
                the Surety to (i) apply or sell any collateral security you
                deposited to reimburse the Surety for any and all Liabilities of
                any kind or nature, (ii) hold, apply or sell the collateral, or
                any part thereof, to protect or reimburse the Surety by reason
                of the execution at any time of any other bond for or on behalf
                of you or Defendant, and (iii) apply and sell the collateral for
                the purpose of placing the Surety in cash funds or protecting
                the Surety against any claim, demand or loss under the Bond or
                any other bond executed on your or Defendant’s behalf. Subject
                to applicable law (if any) as stated in an attached addendum,
                the Surety may make any such sale, at its discretion, at public
                or private sales, and without demand, notice or advertisement of
                the time and place of said sale, and also with the right to
                purchase said collateral at such sale or sales, freed and
                discharged from any equity or redemption.
              </p>
              <br />
              4. The Surety shall not be liable for the depreciation of any
              collateral or for any interest thereon. In the event of
              depreciation of the collateral, or any part thereof, or of any
              collateral which may be hereafter deposited with the Surety for
              its protection, upon request of the Surety, you shall provide the
              Surety with additional and satisfactory collateral so that the
              total market value of the collateral shall, at all times, be equal
              to the market value of the collateral at the time of its initial
              deposit. Subject to applicable law (if any) as stated in an
              attached addendum, if you fail to deposit such additional
              collateral, the Surety shall have the full right, power and
              authority, without further demand or notice, to sell, assign and
              deliver the whole or any part of such collateral, substituted
              collateral, or additional collateral, at public or private sale,
              at its option, and without demand, notice or advertisement, and
              also with the right to purchase said collateral at any such sale,
              freed and discharged from any equity or redemption.
              <br />
              5. If a confession of judgment is taken in connection with the
              Bond, the Surety shall have the right to enter and file the same
              at any time, and such judgment shall be a lien and entitled to a
              preference against any of your property, whether or not the Surety
              is indemnified at the time of the filing or entry of such
              judgment. In case a confession of judgment is filed by the Surety
              against you, the judgment entered shall be effective and available
              to the Surety against you not only in connection with the Bond but
              also in connection with any other bond that may have been written
              by the Surety in which you are either the indemnitor or defendant.
              <br />
              6. You acknowledge and agree that the Surety may foreclose any or
              all of the liens and security interests arising out of the
              transactions relating to the Bond or this Agreement, or exercise
              any of its rights or remedies under this Agreement, or take any
              combination of such actions, without waiving any other right or
              remedy. Failure to exercise any rights or remedies of the Surety
              at any one time shall not constitute a waiver of the right to
              exercise them at any other time. Any security or collateral you
              give may be substituted, subordinated, or released by the Surety
              without affecting any other rights. The Surety shall not be
              obligated to enforce its rights against any security or collateral
              prior to enforcing its rights against you or any other indemnitor.
              <br />
              7. Subject to applicable law (if any) as stated in an attached
              addendum, the Surety will return the collateral to you when all of
              the following are satisfied: (i) the Surety receives competent
              written legal evidence satisfactory to the Surety (for example,
              written notice from the court) of the Surety’s discharge or
              release from all liability under the Bond; (ii) there are no
              outstanding Liabilities of any kind arising out of or relating to
              the Bond; (iii) there are no other outstanding bonds or
              obligations executed by, for or on behalf of you or Defendant in
              connection with which the Surety may deem it advisable to retain
              such collateral for its protection; and (iv) upon the Surety’s
              request, you shall have executed and delivered to the Surety a
              general release upon the Surety’s return of the collateral to you.
              If the Surety deems it necessary to make any outlay to protect any
              collateral or security in its possession, whether the same be real
              or personal property, you authorize the Surety to do so, and you
              agree to indemnify and reimburse the Surety for any such outlay as
              in the judgment of the Surety may be necessary to protect its
              collateral or security, including payment of taxes or liens or
              mortgages and any attorneys’ fees or service fees for time spent
              and/or special services rendered.
              <br />
              8. The Surety shall have the right to transfer and/or assign, in
              whole or in part, its rights and obligations in this Agreement,
              and/or in the Bond to the Producer or any other person or entity
              (“Assignee”) without notice to or consent from you. Subject to any
              limitations imposed upon Assignee by the Surety, Assignee shall
              have the right to enforce in any action, proceeding or otherwise
              any of the Surety’s rights herein or arising out of any of the
              transactions contemplated hereby, and you shall not, and expressly
              waive any right to, assert the claim or defense that Assignee does
              not have the right to enforce such rights in any such action,
              proceeding or otherwise. If more than one bond is made or has been
              made for the Defendant, then this Agreement shall extend to and
              cover all those bonds and the terms of this Agreement shall apply
              to each bond individually or as a group.
              <br />
              9. This Agreement and all documents that are executed in
              connection with this Agreement set forth all the terms of the
              agreement between the Surety and you. All statements,
              representations, promises, agreements, and affirmations made by
              the Surety and its producers and employees prior to or
              contemporaneously with the execution of this Agreement are
              contained within this document, and unless they are specifically
              set forth in this Agreement are of no force or effect whatsoever
              in determining the rights and liabilities of the Surety and you.
              You further agree to execute and be bound by any other future
              documents necessary to carry out and effectuate this Agreement.
              <br />
              10. You hereby acknowledge and agree that neither the Surety nor
              its Producer has recommended or suggested any specific attorney or
              firm of attorneys to represent the Defendant in any capacity.
              <br />
              11. This Agreement may not be terminated or modified orally. All
              modifications and terminations of this Agreement, including any
              release of your liability hereunder, must be in writing and signed
              by the Surety and you.
              <br />
              12. To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, you hereby
              waive any and all rights you may have under federal law
              (including, but not limited to, Title 28 Privacy Act-Freedom of
              Information Act, Title 6, Fair Credit Reporting Act) and any local
              or State law relating to Surety’s obtaining, and you consent to
              and authorize Surety to obtain, any and all private or public
              information and/or records concerning you from any party or
              agency, private or governmental (local, state, federal),
              including, but not limited to, credit reports, Social Security
              Records, criminal records, civil records, driving records, tax
              records, telephone records, medical records, school records,
              worker compensation records, and employment records. You further
              authorize, without reservation, any party or agency, private or
              governmental (local, state, federal), contacted by Surety to
              furnish in accordance with applicable law any and all private and
              public information and records in their possession concerning you
              to the Surety and direct that a copy of this document shall serve
              as evidence of said authorization. You irrevocably grant to surety
              and its producers, agents and representatives the right to enter
              your residence or other property owned or occupied by you or
              Defendant without notice, at any time, for the purpose of
              locating, arresting, and returning to custody the Defendant, and
              subject to applicable law, you waive any and all causes of action
              in connection therewith including, without limitation, torts of
              trespass and false imprisonment.
              <br />
              13. You agree that Surety may attach a location tracking device on
              any vehicle owned or driven by you, at any time, without notice,
              and monitor the location of the vehicle through any available
              technology. You further agree that Surety may use location
              technologies to locate your wireless device at any time during the
              period of Defendant’s bail and any applicable remission period,
              and the Bond is conditioned upon your full compliance with the
              following terms and conditions: (a) Surety, at its discretion,
              will use network-based location technologies to find you; (b) this
              is the only notice you will receive for the collection of your
              location information; (c) Surety will retain location data only
              while the Bond is in force and during any applicable remission
              period; (d) Surety will disclose location information only to the
              courts as required by court order; (e) Surety and its licensed
              producers, designees and representatives will be the only persons
              with access to your location information; (f) YOU WILL NOT HAVE
              THE OPTION TO OPT-OUT OF LOCATION USE OR TRACKING DURING THE BAIL
              PERIOD; and (g) all questions relating to location capability
              should be directed to Surety.
              <br />
              14. In the event any provision herein shall be deemed to exceed
              any applicable state or federal law, then such provision shall
              automatically be deemed to have been revised to comply with such
              law so as to provide the Surety with the maximum protection from
              any loss or liability. The invalidity or unenforceability of any
              provision herein (or portion thereof) shall in no way effect the
              validity or enforceability of any other provision (or portion
              thereof).
              <br />
              15. You have not been paid to sign this Agreement. You have read
              the above contract, understand it and agree to fulfill ALL of the
              provisions therein.
