            forfeited and it is not ordered reinstated, or exonerated, that I
            must pay the full amount of the bail forfeited to the bail agency
            within 30 days.

            is violated.

            bail agency attempt to contact you and find that the phone numbers
            provided are either changed or disconnected, or that the addresses
            provided are not valid, this will result in the defendant being
            returned back to jail and having the bond surrendered. I am
            responsible for any fees that arise from the revocation of the bond.

            substitution of collateral is at the discretion of the bail agency

            a later date.

            of the bond is protected, and that the bond is not forfeited
