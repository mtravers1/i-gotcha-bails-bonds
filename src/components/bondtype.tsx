        <h1>Appeal Bonds in Florida</h1>
        <p>
            In order to understand what an ‘appeal bond’ is, one must first 
            understand the meaning of an ‘appeal’ according to the judicial court system. At the closing of a court hearing, 
            the losing party is offered the ability to have the court’s decision reviewed by the Court of Appeal (a higher court) in an attempt 
            to reverse the final judgment. This is called an appeal.

        What is a federal bond? These bonds are required in order to bail out someone from jail who has 
        been arrested for a federal crime. Typically, 
        federal bonds cost more than state bonds and cannot 
        be issued without first seeing a judge.</p>

        <p>
        In Florida, a Nebbia hold is used to guarantee that funds used
         to release a pretrial inmate were not part of an illegal 
         financial transaction or activity. It is often a condition 
        placed on a defendant's bond when suspected of drug crimes.
