        <h1>Appeal Bonds in Florida</h1>
        <p>
          In order to understand what an ‘appeal bond’ is, one must first
          understand the meaning of an ‘appeal’ according to the judicial court
          system. At the closing of a court hearing, the losing party is offered
          the ability to have the court’s decision reviewed by the Court of
          Appeal (a higher court) in an attempt to reverse the final judgment.
          This is called an appeal.

        What is a federal bond? These bonds are required in order to bail out
        someone from jail who has been arrested for a federal crime. Typically,
        federal bonds cost more than state bonds and cannot be issued without
        first seeing a judge.

      <p>
        In Florida, a Nebbia hold is used to guarantee that funds used to
        release a pretrial inmate were not part of an illegal financial
        transaction or activity. It is often a condition placed on a defendant's
        bond when suspected of drug crimes.

        What is a state bond? State crimes cover a long list of offenses, but in
        all circumstances, a law that was put into place by state legislature
